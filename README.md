# Data_Structures
<p>Data Structures are a specialized means of organizing and storing data in computers in such a way that we can perform operations on the stored data more efficiently. Data structures have a wide and diverse scope of usage across the fields of Computer Science and Software Engineering.</p>
<h3> Programs related to data structures in C++ from my university course.
 Following Data Structures are implemented: </h3>
<li> Binary Tree </li>
<li> Circular Linked List </li>
<li> Double link list </li>
<li> Prioriy Queue </li>
<li> Queue</li>
<li> Stack </li>
<li> Hash tree </li>
<br>

<br>

<p> Data structures are an integral part of computers used for the arrangement of data in memory. They are essential and responsible for organizing, processing, accessing, and storing data efficiently. But this is not all. Various types of data structures have their own characteristics, features, applications, advantages, and disadvantages </p> 
<h3>  Benefits of data structure </h3> 
<li> Data structure modification is easy.  </li> 
<li> It requires less time.</li> 
<li> Save storage memory space </li> 
<li> Data representation is easy</li>
<li> Easy access to the large database </li><br>
